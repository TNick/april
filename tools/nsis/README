This directory contains files used with NSIS 2.46 to generate windows installers.

Some caveats:

Run 

    git archive --format tar.gz -o "./distrib/april-1.0.0.tar.gz" -9 master

to create an archive that contains the source code. Notice the 1.0.0 that is the version.

Also, building with a debug configuration will not do the job even if debug_and_release is selected in .pro files. Each project needs to be switched to release mode and rebuilded.

The compressor is selected in nsis script around line:

;SetCompressor /SOLID lzma
;SetCompressorDictSize 12
SetCompressor /SOLID ZLIB

For a better compression uncomment first two lines and comment third. This is because lzma takes a long time.
