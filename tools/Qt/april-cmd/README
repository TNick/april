april-cmd-help.pro
===========================
This project produces a command line utility (april-cmd) to 
help with the documentation of commands in modules that
are packed inside april-cmd library.

Note that the actual source for the documentation is 
main-cmd-help.cc file. To update/add content modify this file.

Usage for april-cmd utility:
    april-cmd-help ?      prints this help message    
    april-cmd-help u      update the commands in help.dat file    
    april-cmd-help p      print commands from help.dat to console    
    april-cmd-help d      update dox files from help.dat    

help.dat is created or read from current directory. The dox files
are searched relative to current directory in:

../../april/april/docs/commands

A dox file for each module is created/updated in that directory 
with same name as the module. The dox will generate a page
in the documentation (for example module_april.html for april
module).
