This directory contains scripts that may be used to build various parts of this project using qmake[1].
Each directory coresponds to a product or component that may be build.


version.pri
===========

Version information. Gets included in each final product.


library-sources.pri
===================

qmake include file. Groups all the files that compose the library (either static or dynamic). By including these files in a project one can avoid using libraries.


local_defs.pri and local_defs.pri.template
==========================================

The file local_defs.pri is not part of the distribution and needs to be created, based on the guidlines in local_defs.pri.template.
It contains qmake definitions specific to the machine and to the type of build that is desired.
